__Pronounce Precisely__ is an app you can use to check and improve your pronunciation of English words. Using voice recognition software, the app compares your pronunciation to native English speakers.

Record yourself saying a word into the app, and you’ll get instant feedback on your pronunciation – right down to how well you pronounced each individual sound in the word!

* Each word is displayed in Readable English (a unique phonetic representation of English that’s easier than the IPA!)
* Receive instant feedback on your pronunciation for the whole word, for each syllable, and for each individual sound (phoneme) in the word
* Use mouth movement videos and written descriptions to improve your pronunciation
* Includes definitions and translations of words
