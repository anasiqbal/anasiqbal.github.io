The What’s Changed? skill builder has been specifically designed to develop students’ phonemic awareness - the ability to discern the sounds, and the sequence of sounds, within a word. Phonemic awareness is a critical skill for learning to read and can be improved with practice.

What’s Changed? focuses on developing phonemic awareness with vowel sounds and consonant blends through exercises that require students to listen to two non-words and identify what changed between the two words. 

##### Responsibilities
* Worked in a small team and developed the application using Unity 3D and C#.
* Sole UI programmer for HUD, Level and Sub-Level selection screen and Progress screen.
* Implemented complete gameplay. The game had a data driven gameplay and result based level progression.
* Integrated SOAP web-service developed by the another team working offshore in Australia.
